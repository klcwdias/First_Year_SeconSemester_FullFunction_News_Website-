               <h3>EARTHQUAKE: TWO DEAD AFTER JAPAN HIT BY TREMOR</h3>
           
               </div>
           
           <br>
           <p>On Wednesday night, a strong earthquake struck north-east Japan, knocking off power to two million people.

The tremor, measuring magnitude 7.3, occurred in the same area where a massive earthquake caused the Fukushima nuclear accident 11 years ago.



Officials say two individuals have died and at least 90 have been hurt.<br><br>



People were unable to stand in certain spots, and buildings in Tokyo trembled, according to the AFP news agency.
According to Japanese authorities, the quake struck at 23:36 (14:36 GMT) at a depth of 57 kilometers (35.4 miles).

Aftershocks are expected in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi, and Yamagata.
Immediately following the incident, Japan's meteorological service issued a tsunami warning for areas of the north-east coast, but it has now been cancelled, according to Japanese station NHK.<br><br>

About 700,000 residences in Tokyo and 156,000 in Japan's north-east were left without power immediately after the earthquake, according to local electrical suppliers, but many homes have already been restored.
Several persons were injured by falling objects or in falls across north-eastern Japan, and one man in his sixties died in Soma, Fukushima Prefecture, according to local media. Miyagi Prefecture was the site of the second death.

According to its operator, the quake also derailed a bullet train north of Fukushima city. There were no early reports of anyone being hurt as a result of the incident.<br><br>

Fumio Kishida, Japan's prime minister, told reporters that the government was still assessing the extent of any damage, and that emergency services had been flooded with requests.

A local official in Ishinomaki told AFP that he was jolted awake by "very intense shaking."



"The earth began to rumble. Rather than being terrified, I was reminded of the Great East Japan Earthquake "He was alluding to the disaster in 2011.<br><br>
